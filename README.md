# API Validation

By using try catch and async methode to handel internal routing level, so even frontend devs can read what an API endpoint expects without need to writting a documentation that can get outdated quickly.
and this is example of adding a new admin request at the routing .

```js
router.post("/", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const admin = new Admin(req.body);
    await admin.save();
    const token = await admin.generateAuthToken();
    res.status(201).json({ admin, token });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).send(err);
  }
});
```

**Example error**

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "message": "child \"email\" fails because [\"email\" is required]"
  }
}
```
